üìå Instagram Fake Account Detection Using Machine Learning
A comprehensive machine learning project to detect fake Instagram accounts using multi-modal features including biography text, profile images, and numerical account metadata.

üìÇ Project Overview
This project utilizes state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (BERT), Computer Vision (ResNet50), and Machine Learning (XGBoost) techniques to classify Instagram accounts as real or fake with high accuracy.

‚úÖ Key Objectives
Extract meaningful insights from biography, followers/following counts, and profile pictures.

Classify Instagram accounts using XGBoost, combining textual, image, and numerical features.

Achieve high accuracy with model explainability using SHAP analysis.
